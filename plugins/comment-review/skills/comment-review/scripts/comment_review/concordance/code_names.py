    """Every name the tree DEFINES, harvested from the AST.

    A corpus built from raw text contains the comments being checked, so every
    obituary resolves against itself and the check always passes. Unreadable
    files are RETURNED alongside the names: a hole in the corpus turns every
    symbol defined only there into a false obituary, which fails loud and wrong.

    ! TRACKED files only, when git can say which. A vendored, generated or
    gitignored tree under the repo root otherwise donates its whole namespace,
    so a symbol the repo defines nowhere resolves ALIVE. That failure is SILENT
    and one-sided: it can hide an obituary, and manufactures none.

    Args:
        roots: directories or files to harvest.
        tracked: absolute paths git reports as tracked, or None when git could
            not answer -- in which case the whole tree is walked and the caller
            is told, so a change in coverage arrives with the result.

    Returns:
        The set of defined names, and the rows naming every gap in it. A row
        holding `NO_HARVESTER` is a KNOWN hole and a row holding `WALKED_TREE`
        is a caveat about the whole corpus; anything else is a file this
        process genuinely could not read or parse. A caller that tells the
        three apart says so with those two constants -- the three read alike as
        prose, and a caller matching on the prose reclassifies them silently
        the next time this wording changes.
